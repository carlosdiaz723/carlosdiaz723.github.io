# N Club Georgia's Website

This is a work in progress by the admins of N Club Georgia.

The current goals are to house the newsletters and act as a unified source of truth,
to minimize the discrepancy of knowledge we currently face between
Newsletters, Facebook posts, Facebook chats, Discord, Instagram, and any other outlets. 

If you can program and/or would like to contribute in some other way (art assets, suggestions, testing, etc), please contact Carlos (@tortuga) on our Discord.
